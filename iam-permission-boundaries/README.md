In this how-to-guide, we demonstrate how you can prevent privilege escalations using AWS IAM permission boundaries. IAM permission boundaries are policies that define the maximum level of permissions that can be applied to an IAM user or role. You still need to define IAM policies to define the individual IAM user's or role's permissions, but an entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
Often user can take advantage of IAM policies if these are too relaxed or not configured to cover certain scenarios where an IAM user can circumvent certain loopholes. Here, permission boundaries can be carefully defined to ensure such actions are impossible as is the case in our how-to-guide.
This git repository comes with an exam policy document that you can use as a permission boundary. You will need to edit the document to define your AWS Account-ID and also make changes to remove any policy you do not want to enforce.
